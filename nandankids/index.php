                            <p>We provide our students with a safe learning environment that helps them grow as unique personalities.

                            <p>Along with traditional lessons, we encourage our students to open their minds to a myriad of extracurricular activities, from Music and Dance to swimming and games.

                            <p>A school is only as good as its teachers, and as one of the Top International schools in India, we know we have to hire the best. Every teacher in our team must undergo a rigorous hiring process before attending the in-house teachers training program. Apart from observing lessons, the teachers have to give assessments to ensure their subject matter knowledge is up to our standards. We also train our teachers to adopt our teaching methodologies and ensure that they regularly participate in curriculum workshops and subject-specific seminars to stay updated at all times.</p>
                            <p>How many times have you typed “CBSE schools near me” or even “Schools near me” into your search bar just to find institutes that do not match your vision of education for your child? With Nandan Kids Hr. Sec. School, you can rest assured that your child is in good hands.</p>
